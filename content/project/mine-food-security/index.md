In collaboration with Molly Brown and Meredith T Niles, I have worked on a project text mining 16000 abstracts related to Food Security to better understand where the literature focuses and how different themes have changed in the literature.  Initial results suggest that the literature is highly biased toward certain countries, and that there is no relationship between the focus of the food security literature and where actual food insecurity exists.
