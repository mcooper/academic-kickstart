Supported by the National Socio-Ecological Synthesis Center (SESYNC), I am working with a team of graduate students to analyse text data captured before, during and after a climate shock to better understand how these shocks affect people's mental health and attitudes towards climate change.  We are using datasets like Twitter and traditional news media, and analysis techniques like Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling.
