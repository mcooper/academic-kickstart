I am a PhD student in Geographical Sciences at the University of Maryland, where I study the environment and human well-being.  Before my starting my PhD, I lived all over the world - from Mali to Alaska to the Philippines - working at the intersection of policy and research.  Now, I work with large datasets at global scales using data science methods, but with my research questions and hypotheses deeply informed by my experiences in the field and in the policy sector.
